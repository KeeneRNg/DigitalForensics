# DigitalForensics
This device forensics project was performed by Matthew Goh and Keene Ng (myself). We researched on open source forensics tools and executed the forensics investigative processes for both Windows and Linux machines.

Matthew researched and utilized PhotoRec and Stegosuite. The tools performed data recovery from an external storage media's unallocated space and stegonography respectively.

Keene researched and utilized AVML (Aquire Volatile Memory For Linux) tool and Volatility. The tools performed volatile memory aquisition from a linux (Ubuntu) machine and analysis of memory dumps respectively.

Additionally, as a team we utilized EnCase forensics tools to analyse a Windows hard drive image and generated a forensics RTF report and after, published an examiners report documenting all evidence found, forensics processes and conclusions found.
